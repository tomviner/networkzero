Introduction
------------

The discovery module implements a UDP beacon in a daemon thread to advertise 
a directory of name-to-address mappings. The names are added to the directory 
via the :func:`advertise` function, and discovered via :func:`discover`. 
A list of all currently-advertised names can be obtained by calling 
:func:`discover_all`.

When a name is advertised, if no address is supplied, one
is generated by combining the first of the host's IP addresses with a port
randomly selected from the list of valid dynamic ports [0xC000 - 0xFFFF].
While the selected port is removed from the list for the purposes of the
networkzero package, there's a slim chance that it might be in use by some 
other process.
